			<h2>What is reduce()?</h2>

			<p>
				While <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> is a fairly simple
				method once you wrap your head around it, I think it is much more
				complicated to understand than <code class="code-inline">map()</code> or
				<code class="code-inline">filter()</code>, so this post will be much
				longer than the respective posts for
				<code class="code-inline">map()</code> or
				<code class="code-inline">filter()</code> as a result. According to the
				<a
					class="inline-link"
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce"
					>Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a
				>
				web documentation, "The <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> method
				executes a <b>reducer</b> function (that you provide) on each element of
				the array, resulting in a single output value.‚Äù
			</p>

			<p>
				Now what the heck does that mean for us?
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> takes an array, iterates
				through it, and performs whatever actions we instruct it inside of the
				callback function, returning a new item based upon the actions we
				provide. Unlike <code class="code-inline">map()</code> and
				<code class="code-inline">filter()</code>, we have <b>two</b> required
				parameters inside of the callback function that we provide: an
				<b>accumulator</b> and a <b>currentValue</b>. The <b>currentValue</b> is
				the same as <code class="code-inline">map()</code> or
				<code class="code-inline">filter()</code>: it is the current element in
				the array that we are performing the iteration upon. However, we also
				have this weird parameter called <b>accumulator</b> that we have to
				provide. The <b>accumulator</b> will always be equal to the value we
				returned in the <b>previous</b> iteration. There is an
				<b>optional</b> parameter that we can also pass to
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> (<b>NOT</b> inside of the
				callback function, as the second parameter in our call of
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code>) called <b>initialValue</b>,
				that sets the initial value of <b>accumulator</b>. If you do not give an
				<b>initialValue</b> to <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> (which
				as I mentioned, you do not have to),
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> will simply set the
				<b>initialValue</b> of the <b>accumulator</b> to the first value in the
				array which <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> was called on. Now
				that was a lot of information thrown at you, and you are probably still
				confused as to how <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> works, so
				let‚Äôs jump into a basic example!

              console.log(maxAge); // 67
            </code>
          </pre>
			</div>

			<p>
				In this first example, we are using
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> to get the maximum value from
				our array <code class="code-inline">ages</code>.
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> will loop over our array and
				for each value in that array, return the higher age between
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> and
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code>. If you haven‚Äôt seen the
				<code class="code-inline">Math.max()</code> function before, all it is
				doing is returning the higher value between whatever two arguments that
				you pass to it (just like many methods in the built-in
				<code class="code-inline">Math</code> object,
				<code class="code-inline">Math.max()</code> is very useful). You'll
				notice that we don't pass an <b>initialValue</b> to
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> in this function. While you
				might initially think that on the first iteration
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code> would be set to <b>21</b>,
				it is actually set to <b>43</b>. ü§Ø What??! Let me explain.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because we don‚Äôt provide that <b>initialValue</b> to
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code>, our
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> will be equal to
				<b>21</b> and <code class="code-inline">currentAge</code> will be equal
				to <b>43</b>, which means that we will only loop 4 times instead of the
				5 that you may have anticipated! If we were to see the values of
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> and
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code> for each iteration, we would
				see the following:

			<p>
				As you can see, <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> only loops 4
				times since it sets the initial value of
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> to the first value in our
				array (<b>21</b>). In each iteration, we return the higher number
				between the <code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> and the
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code>. Now, you might be asking
				"Ben. Is this really all that different from running a
				<code class="code-inline">for</code> loop that uses the same comparison
				(<code class="code-inline">Math.max(accumulator, currentAge</code>) to
				change a predefined value?‚Äù No, not really. But once you understand what
				is going on with <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code>, this syntax
				not only becomes much more clean to look at for you and other developers
				you might work with, but unlocks even more powerful code that you can
				write! This is a fairly trivial example meant to show you in an easy
				manner how <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> works. Before we
				move on to a more complicated example, let‚Äôs refactor the above snippet
				to demonstrate how to set the <b>initialValue</b> for
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> as well as use one of my
				favorite things in Javascript: the <b>ternary operator</b>!

			<p>
				If you're not familiar with the <b>ternary operator</b>, it‚Äôs a very
				useful feature that the
				<a
					class="inline-link"
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator"
					>Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a
				>
				will explain in greater detail than I will here. The
				<b>ternary operator</b> is at its core a shorter syntax for an
				<b>if/else</b> block of code. You start with an expression the resolves
				to a <b>truthy</b> or <b>falsy</b> value and use the
				<code class="code-inline">?</code> to denote that if that value is
				<b>truthy</b>, you want to do something based on that expression.
				Otherwise if the expression is <b>falsy</b>, you will default to some
				other code that comes after the <code class="code-inline">:</code> .
			</p>

			<p>
				In the above example, our expression is
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator &gt; currentAge</code>, the code
				we want to run if that is <b>truthy</b> is
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code>, and the code we want to
				run otherwise is <code class="code-inline">currentAge</code>. Notice
				that we are using this <b>ternary operator</b> statement <b>after</b> a
				<code class="code-inline">return</code> keyword. That means that if our
				expression
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator &gt; currentAge</code> is
				<b>truthy</b>, we will be returning
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code>. If it is <b>falsy</b> we
				will return <code class="code-inline">currentAge</code>. While we could
				use <code class="code-inline">Math.max()</code> to get the higher number
				between two numbers, I think it more clearly demonstrates what we are
				checking within <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code>. Every
				iteration, we are checking whether or not the previous largest value
				(our <code class="code-inline">accumulator</code>) is greater than the
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code> that we are comparing. If it
				is, we return the <code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> as we
				want to continue to remember the <b>greatest</b> value. If
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code> is greater, we return
				<code class="code-inline">currentAge</code>, which is what
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> will set the
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> of the next iteration equal
				to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that in this example, our reduce() function will run
				<b>5 times</b>, since we provide it an
				<code class="code-inline">initialValue</code> of 0. ‚ÄúBut Ben!" you might
				say, ‚Äúthis returns 67 just like the first snippet we looked at! Why
				would we provide an initialValue and make
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> run an extra time?‚Äù And that
				would be a great observation! Let‚Äôs look at another example where we can
				see why explicitly setting an
				<code class="code-inline">initialValue</code> might be useful to us!

				It returns the same value? Did you spot the bug in this code? Even I
				missed it at first, but when I played around with this example some more
				to understand why it returned 67, the answer was clear. This code does
				not run the way we are wanting it to, even though it does run correctly.
				On the first iteration, our
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> is set equal to the first
				value in <code class="code-inline">people</code> since we don‚Äôt provide
				an <code class="code-inline">initalValue</code>. That means that for our
				first iteration, we are asking Javascript to tell us if
				<code class="code-inline"
					>{ firstName: ‚ÄúBen‚Äù, lastName: ‚ÄúSmith‚Äù, age: 21 } &gt; 21</code
				>. Well clearly we can‚Äôt compare an object with an integer, right?
				Unlike many other programming languages, Javascript is a bit weird when
				it comes to what it considers to be <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.
				Instead of throwing an error at us when we try to compare an object to
				an integer (like many other languages would), Javascript evaluates the
				statement
				<code class="code-inline"
					>{ firstName: ‚ÄúBen‚Äù, lastName: ‚ÄúSmith‚Äù, age: 21 } &gt; 21</code
				>
				as <b>false</b>. So our first iteration returns <b>43</b> because when
				that expression evaluates to <b>false</b>, we return
				<code class="code-inline">person.age</code>, which is <b>43</b>. So our
				code actually continues to execute the same from here on out as when we
				gave <code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> an
				<code class="code-inline">initialValue</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				What if we were to <b>rearrange</b> the objects in our array? Let‚Äôs move
				the fourth item in our array to the <b>beginning</b> of our array, and
				re-run the same code (without an
				<code class="code-inline">initialValue</code>) and see what happens:

				This returns <b>43</b>? Now we can start to truly see the problem with
				not passing an <code class="code-inline">initialValue</code>! If we
				didn‚Äôt know what this data looked like (for instance if we were pulling
				data from a database and trying to get the highest age without ever
				seeing the data ourselves) and we tried to run this, we might not ever
				notice the issue with this code. But clearly <b>43</b> is <b>not</b> the
				highest age. You and I can both see that clearly! The issue is because
				our <code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> is equal to the first
				item in the array by default, and that item <b>happens</b> to have our
				highest age! In our first iteration, Javascript checks the expression
				<code class="code-inline"
					>{ firstName: ‚ÄúJulie‚Äù, lastName: ‚ÄúDonaldson‚Äù, age: 67 } &gt; 21</code
				>, which it evaluates to <b>false</b>. That means that
				<code class="code-inline">person.age</code>, or <b>21</b> is passed to
				the next iteration as our accumulator <b>instead</b> of 67 which is our
				actual highest age!
			</p>

			<p>
				This is why passing an <code class="code-inline">initialValue</code> is
				so useful in certain circumstances. We can set an
				<code class="code-inline">initialValue</code> of 0 to our
				<code class="code-inline">accumulator</code> so that on its first
				iteration, no matter what order our
				<code class="code-inline">people</code> data is in, it will always be
				comparing <b>integers</b> in our expression. In the first iteration with
				our <code class="code-inline">initialValue</code> of 0, it would check
				if <code class="code-inline">0 &gt; 21</code>, and we know that for you
				to be alive you have to be more than 0 years old.
			</p>

			<p>
				I hope this introduction to
				<code class="code-inline">reduce()</code> was helpful to you! There are
				many more use cases and more complex things that you can do with it, so
				I encourage you to go out and experiment!
